# Guess-The-Rating
Guess the Rating consists of the following things that need to be done (add more if you think of any):
1. Start Screen
2. Display a movie, allow for both players to input a score (maybe make this ran all on one screen first bc I have literally zero idea how to do an online game lol)
3. Compare both guesses to actual rating, give point to the winner.
4. Do other front-end magic???


(Use python-sql as way to use SQL in python... looks better than the other thing)
